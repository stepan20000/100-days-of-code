**Today's Progress**: Finished Random Quote Machin and make it works on published on the GitHub page. 
Thanks to bengitter.github.io. He show me a problem. The browser goes to GitHub website on https protocol and then try to
download a quote from http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/random.json on http protocol this generates a Mixed Content
error. So I taked the code from here  https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere and adopted it for my
Random Quote Mashine.  

**Thoughts**: It was nice experience. Good feeling when your code works. Sometimes need help comrades.
The Read-Ask-Search method works.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

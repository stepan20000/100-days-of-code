### Day 2: January 5, 2017, Thursday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Random Quote Machin and make it works on published on the GitHub page. 
Thanks to bengitter.github.io. He show me a problem. The browser goes to GitHub website on https protocol and then try to
download a quote from http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/random.json on http protocol this generates a Mixed Content
error. So I taked the code from here  https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere and adopted it for my
Random Quote Mashine.  

**Thoughts**: It was nice experience. Good feeling when your code works. Sometimes need help comrades.
The Read-Ask-Search method works.

### Day 4: January 7, 2017, Saturday
##### 

**Today's Progress**:  Started to work with the Show the Local Weather project. At the moment I can send the request and then receive json data from the openweathermap.org. Also I can  print this received data.

### Day 5: January 8, 2017, Sunday
##### 

**Today's Progress**:  All day try to have a deal with navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition, thought that should run it in sync mode. Then understood that just can call the getWeather function from the getLocation function. Facepalm. 

**Thoughts**:  Spent a lot of time with little results again. Why am I so uninteligent.

### Day 6: January 9, 2017, Monday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked with the Show the Local Weather project. At the moment I can receive the weather data from the https://openweathermap.org/current#geo and write to the page all what I need. Also I can obtain the location and receive the weather parameters for current location. And I can obtain the current date with specified format. Now is the point for a design. 

**Thoughts**:  From this point I can directly create the Project. Work much more interesting when you already know what and how to do it.

## Day 18 January 21, 2017, Saturday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Today I nad a deal with the online and offline chanels on tvitch tv. Realised thet I have to make to requests  first to the "twitch-api/streams/" for defining whether the channel is onlime or not and second "twitch-api/channels/" for taking other info. Now  I should decide how to make this two requests in what order and how to make a loop(two loops or one loop). Remember that $.getJSON is asynch. At the moment I can make requests ond receive info from tvitch tv api I also figured out what and where is needed info in the tvitch tv api response.  

**Thoughts**: I am not happy with the speed of my progress

## Day 19 January 22, 2017, Sunday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked with the twitch tv project only a bit. Маde requests and succesfully write result to the page.  

**Thoughts**: I used the trick that I read in the [You Don't Know JavaScript book](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch5.md). Reading books is usefull even if you don't understand much

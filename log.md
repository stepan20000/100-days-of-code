# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017, Tuesday


### Day 1: January 4, 2017, Wednesday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Random Quote Machin.  But have a problem with ajax when publish on GitHub pages. https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/cant-receive-json-with-getjson-or-ajax-when-publish-on-github-pages/72438  

**Thoughts**: Why it's not working on github???

### Day 2: January 5, 2017, Thursday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Random Quote Machin and make it works on published on the GitHub page. 
Thanks to bengitter.github.io. He show me a problem. The browser goes to GitHub website on https protocol and then try to
download a quote from http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/random.json on http protocol this generates a Mixed Content
error. So I taked the code from here  https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere and adopted it for my
Random Quote Mashine.  

**Thoughts**: It was nice experience. Good feeling when your code works. Sometimes need help comrades.
The Read-Ask-Search method works.

### Day 3: January 6, 2017, Friday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Today I updated all my previous works and optimized my github repositories. I added all my works in to the one repository also made test repository for testing.  

**Thoughts**:  Only hard work can help to achieve results.

### Day 4: January 7, 2017, Saturday
##### 

**Today's Progress**:  Started to work with the Show the Local Weather project. At the moment I can send the request and then receive json data from the openweathermap.org. Also I can  print this received data. 

**Thoughts**:  Spent a lot of time with little results.

### Day 5: January 8, 2017, Sunday
##### 

**Today's Progress**:  All day try to have a deal with navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition, thought that should run it in sync mode. Then understood that just can call the getWeather function from the getLocation function. Facepalm. 

**Thoughts**:  Spent a lot of time with little results again. Why am I so uninteligent.

### Day 6: January 9, 2017, Monday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked with the Show the Local Weather project. At the moment I can receive the weather data from the https://openweathermap.org/current#geo and write to the page all what I need. Also I can obtain the location and receive the weather parameters for current location. And I can obtain the current date with specified format. Now is the point for a design. 

**Thoughts**:  From this point I can directly create the Project. Work much more interesting when you already know what and how to do it.

## Day 17 January 20, 2017, Friday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Started the twitchtv project. Just tried to understand all this. Didn't code a lot.

**Thoughts**: Don't know. That is a bit complicated at the moment

## Day 18 January 21, 2017, Saturday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Today I nad a deal with the online and offline chanels on tvitch tv. Realised thet I have to make to requests  first to the "twitch-api/streams/" for defining whether the channel is onlime or not and second "twitch-api/channels/" for taking other info. Now  I should decide how to make this two requests in what order and how to make a loop(two loops or one loop). Remember that $.getJSON is asynch. At the moment I can make requests ond receive info from tvitch tv api I also figured out what and where is needed info in the tvitch tv api response.  

**Thoughts**: I am not happy with the speed of my progress

## Day 19 January 22, 2017, Sunday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked with the twitch tv project only a bit. Маde requests and succesfully write result to the page.  

**Thoughts**: I used the trick that I read in the [You Don't Know JavaScript book](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch5.md). Reading books is usefull even if you don't understand much

## Day 23 January 26, 2017, Thursday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I decided to describe more carefully todays progress.
  - Wrote the status and channel name into the one column
  - Vertical aligned all columns in the grid
  - Added an ID to the each row and use this ID to write results
  - Wrapped the code which write results to the page in to the printResult function
  - Made radiobuttons "all", "online" and "offline" work 
  - Added styling 

**Thoughts**: I must use time management

**Today's Progress**: 
  - A user can type to the text-field the username and then informerion appears on the top of the result div.
  - Optimized my JavaScript functions. Create the functions fillRow (fills the row with the corresponding information), printResult(prints the info of streamers in the userNames array), addResult(prints an info of the username entered to the text-field), filterResults(make the filtering radiobutton works)

## Day 26 January 29, 2017, Sunday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
  - This day progress is not big. I tried to make better my ugly mixed type buttons(with radio input symmbol). If I add attribute data-toggle="buttons" to my buttons div, my event listener doesn't work but buttons are free from the radio symbol. I don't know why event listener stop working in this case.

## Day 27 January 30, 2017, Monday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
  - Make my filter button appearance lake a button-group but worling like a input type="radio" so I can access to the value of the each radio input. This can be done just using $("input[type=radio]").hide().

**Today's Progress**: 
- Made the buttons to type="radio", data-toggle="buttons" didn't use $("input[type=radio]").hide(), changed event listeners to $('.btn-group').on('click', and then check the event.target.id 
- Figured out how to change background for the bootstrap's buttons and for different states of a buttons

**Thoughts**:  Plan to finish Twitch tv tomorrow. Need to make nice buttons color, add a anchor to the rows with results, may be add some styling, bring the code to the good conditions.

##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the portfolio_ver_0 again. For now can dynamically fill in the "works" section. Try to work with flexbox. Use Clearfix and resetCSS. 

**Thoughts**: The make up is still hard for me. I am disquieted about the very low speed of progress. It is not hard to understand a things but hard to use it, hard to create a real web pages.

- Started to figure out how to make animation which I want.

**Thoughts**: Why I often don't have  any thoughts?

**Today's Progress**: Added some styling to the calculator. Also made to work onOfswitch.     

**Thoughts**: I know that calculator can be made with the procedure style program. I tried to make it with "OOP" style. Just because I want to figure out how this is done in javascript. I want to understand how to use "this" and encapsulate my code from everything else in one constructor function and one object.

**Today's Progress**: Make the function MakeCalc.prototype._showOnScreen which displays on the screen the number given as a parameter. This function is not competed.

**Thoughts**:  I want my calculator works similar to the Elektronica MK-23A. When the result is more than 99999999 it should display the value without last digits and all dots should be visible. Then after pressing the "Clear" button the only one dot in place which correspond the number of digits which are not displayed should be visible. 

Will make this functionality tomorrow.
If the number is over 99999999 the function set the this.overflowFlag to true and every time to be executed this function save the current number to the this.currentNumberDisplayed. 

Then event handler which correspond to the "Clear" button will read this flag
